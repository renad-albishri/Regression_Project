# Diamonds Price Prediction

This project aimed to use a regression linear model on a diamonds dataset to predict the price depends on many features. The challenge that gives value to our project is web scraping by selenium and beautiful soup library


# Data Collection

- The data from https://www.brilliantearth.com/loose-diamonds/search/ 
- 86627 rows and 10 columns

![price_carat.png](attachment:price_carat.png)

we observe the carat is highly correlated with price 
we can see from this plot if carat increased also the price increased.

![clarity%20vs%20price.png](attachment:clarity%20vs%20price.png)

we observe that FL which is type of clarity is more expensive than other types

# Future work
we will train various machine learning algorithms like:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression 
- Polynomial Regression


```python

```
